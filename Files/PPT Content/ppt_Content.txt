Perfect 👍 I’ve compared your two files —

📄 **WriteVision_PPT_Content.md** → detailed 8-slide “review-style” presentation (focused on project phases, updates, challenges, and next steps).
📄 **WriteVision_PPT_Minimal.md** → compact “technical demo” deck (focused on training pipeline, dataset, results, and implementation).

## 🧭 Combined PPT Outline (Recommended Deck)

Here’s a **final 9-slide outline** that merges the best parts of both versions — balanced for your next review presentation or final showcase.

---

### **Slide 1 — Title**

**WriteVision: Handwritten Text Recognition (OCR using Microsoft TrOCR)**

* Presenter: *Yash Garg*
* College: *[Your College Name]*
* Semester: *B.Tech CSE – 5th Sem*
* Subject: *Machine Learning Project*

🗣️ *Intro line:*
“Good morning everyone, I’ll be presenting our Machine Learning project — WriteVision — a handwritten text recognition system built using Microsoft’s TrOCR model.”

---

### **Slide 2 — Problem & Goal**

**Problem:**

* Handwritten text varies widely in style and shape, making recognition challenging.
* Small datasets, noise, and irregular spacing cause OCR systems to fail.

**Goal:**

* Build an ML model that converts handwritten text images into digital text.
* Fine-tune it locally for personalized handwriting recognition.

🗣️ *“We aim to make a lightweight handwriting OCR that works offline and learns from our own writing style.”*

---

### **Slide 3 — Technology Stack**

* **Python** – model training & preprocessing
* **PyTorch + Hugging Face Transformers** – TrOCR model
* **Flask** – local web interface
* **OpenCV** – image cleanup and resizing
* **Local setup:** Windows (RTX GPU / Colab GPU)

🗣️ *“We implemented this project completely in Python using PyTorch and Hugging Face APIs.”*

---

### **Slide 4 — Model Architecture**

* **Encoder–Decoder (Seq2Seq)** architecture
* Encoder: Vision Transformer (ViT) extracts image features
* Decoder: Text Transformer generates output text
* Fine-tuned locally → encoder frozen, decoder trained
* Model path: `models/writevision-trocr-finetuned`

🗣️ *“We fine-tuned only the decoder part to make training faster and more stable on small datasets.”*

---

### **Slide 5 — Dataset & Preprocessing**

* Custom dataset: 24 handwritten images + labels (`labels.csv`)
* Format: one image per text line
* Example samples: *“Second”*, *“Parbhat”*, *“Brawl Star”*
* Preprocessing:

  * Resize → 384×384
  * Grayscale → Normalize
  * Augmentations: blur, contrast boost (for clarity)

🗣️ *“We created our own dataset since public handwriting datasets were too large or unaligned.”*

---

### **Slide 6 — Training Details**

* **Batch size:** 2
* **Epochs:** 30
* **Learning rate:** 5e-5
* **Decoder-only fine-tuning** (encoder frozen)
* **Loss:** decreased from *4.59 → <0.001* by epoch 15
* **Checkpoints:** saved per epoch for rollback

🗣️ *“The model became stable after 15 epochs, giving near-zero loss.”*

---

### **Slide 7 — Results & Demo**

**Predictions:**

| Input      | Output     |
| ---------- | ---------- |
| Second     | Second     |
| Parbhat    | Parbhat    |
| Brawl Star | Brawl Star |

* Flask web app: upload image → get recognized text instantly.
* Local URL: `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`

🗣️ *“We built a web app where users can upload a handwritten image and instantly get the predicted text.”*

---

### **Slide 8 — Improvements Since Review 1**

* Added **Flask UI** for user-friendly interaction.
* Switched to **decoder-only training** for better accuracy.
* Expanded dataset (7 → 24 samples).
* Added repetition controls & checkpoint saving.
* Fixed incorrect outputs via preprocessing adjustments.

🗣️ *“After the first review, we focused on improving usability and training stability.”*

---

### **Slide 9 — Future Work**

* Add **more data** and **validation metrics (CER/WER)**.
* Include **greedy decoding** for consistent results.
* Explore **light augmentation** and mobile deployment.
* Build a small **desktop app** version.

🗣️ *“We plan to enhance the model’s accuracy using more handwriting data and turn this into a deployable offline tool.”*
