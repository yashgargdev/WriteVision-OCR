## **1. Abstract**

Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) remains one of the most complex and practically relevant problems in the field of Machine Learning and Computer Vision. The diversity of human handwriting ‚Äî in style, shape, and orientation ‚Äî makes it difficult for machines to interpret text accurately. The **WriteVision** project aims to address this challenge by developing a machine learning‚Äìbased system capable of converting handwritten images into digital, machine-readable text.

We utilize **Microsoft‚Äôs TrOCR model**, a state-of-the-art transformer-based architecture, as the backbone of our solution. TrOCR integrates a **Vision Transformer (ViT)** encoder and a **Text Transformer** decoder to directly translate an image into text in an end-to-end manner. The model is fine-tuned locally on a **custom dataset** consisting of handwritten samples collected and labeled by the team.

Our approach focuses on lightweight fine-tuning ‚Äî freezing the encoder and training only the decoder ‚Äî to adapt the model efficiently with minimal computational resources. The project concludes with a working prototype integrated into a simple **Flask web application** that allows users to upload handwritten images and get recognized text outputs instantly.

## **2. Introduction**

The digital revolution has made the digitization of handwritten content increasingly important. Educational institutions, banks, government agencies, and archives still rely heavily on handwritten documents. Converting these into editable, searchable digital formats can save enormous time and resources.

However, handwriting recognition remains a difficult task. Unlike printed text, which follows standardized fonts, handwriting varies significantly from person to person in terms of shape, slant, spacing, and pressure. Even the same writer can produce inconsistent characters across lines or pages.

Traditional OCR (Optical Character Recognition) systems, such as **Tesseract**, were designed primarily for printed fonts. They often fail to generalize across handwriting styles, leading to inaccurate results. To overcome these limitations, we leverage **Deep Learning** and **Transformer-based architectures**, which are known for their ability to learn contextual representations and long-range dependencies.

**WriteVision** is our attempt to create a **robust and personalized handwritten OCR system**. It fine-tunes Microsoft‚Äôs TrOCR model using custom handwriting samples, making it capable of understanding unique writing patterns.

The final deliverable of the project is an interactive **Flask-based web app** that allows users to upload handwritten images and instantly receive recognized text.

## **3. Problem Statement**

Handwritten text recognition poses multiple challenges:

1. **High variation in handwriting styles:** Different people write letters differently, and even the same person‚Äôs handwriting may vary.
2. **Noisy and low-quality images:** Scanned documents often include smudges, ink variations, or lighting artifacts.
3. **Limited labeled data:** Public datasets for handwriting are either too large (requiring GPUs) or too small to generalize well.
4. **Character spacing & slant:** Handwritten letters may connect or overlap, making segmentation difficult.
5. **Hardware constraints:** High-end GPUs are often required to train deep models, limiting accessibility.

Thus, our objective is to **design a model that can learn effectively from small data**, handle real-world handwriting variability, and run efficiently on local hardware.

---

## **4. Objectives**

The main objectives of **WriteVision** are:

* To build a **deep learning model** that recognizes handwritten text images with high accuracy.
* To **fine-tune Microsoft‚Äôs TrOCR model** using custom handwriting data for local training.
* To design an **end-to-end OCR system** that works without manual segmentation.
* To develop a **Flask-based user interface** that allows users to test handwritten recognition easily.
* To evaluate the system‚Äôs performance using metrics like **loss reduction**, **Word Error Rate (WER)**, and **Character Error Rate (CER)**.
* To explore **improvement techniques** like data augmentation and transfer learning for future scalability.

---

## **5. Literature Review**

Early research in handwriting recognition used **rule-based** or **template-matching** methods, which were fragile and inflexible.
Later, **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** became popular for feature extraction, while **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)** and **LSTMs** were used to model sequences.

The **CNN-RNN-CTC** pipeline (Connectionist Temporal Classification) became the standard for OCR, as seen in models like CRNN. However, these models struggled with:

* Variable-length sequences,
* Difficulty in handling context between words,
* High computational cost for large datasets.

The arrival of **Transformers** revolutionized NLP tasks and, more recently, vision tasks. Microsoft‚Äôs **TrOCR (Transformer OCR)** integrates a **Vision Transformer** encoder (for image understanding) and a **Text Transformer** decoder (for sequence generation). Unlike CRNNs, TrOCR performs **direct image-to-text translation** without explicit segmentation.

Several studies have shown that TrOCR outperforms previous OCR models, particularly for cursive and irregular handwriting. This motivated us to adopt TrOCR as our base model.

## **6. System Design and Architecture**

### **6.1 Model Architecture**

The **TrOCR model** has two main components:

* **Vision Encoder (ViT):** Converts an input image into a sequence of visual embeddings.
* **Text Decoder (Transformer):** Generates text token by token using these embeddings.

**Pipeline:**

```
Input Handwritten Image ‚Üí Encoder (ViT) ‚Üí Visual Features
‚Üí Decoder (Text Transformer) ‚Üí Predicted Text Sequence
```

### **6.2 Why TrOCR?**

* Already pretrained on **IAM** and **Bentham** handwriting datasets.
* Robust to handwriting variations.
* Easy to integrate with **Hugging Face Transformers**.
* Supports **transfer learning**, saving time and computational cost.

### **6.3 Architecture Diagram (Description)**

1. **Image Input:** Preprocessed and normalized.
2. **Feature Extraction:** Encoder converts image to a sequence of embeddings.
3. **Sequence Modeling:** Decoder predicts tokens using attention mechanisms.
4. **Loss Computation:** Cross-entropy between predicted and actual text tokens.
5. **Backpropagation:** Decoder weights updated to minimize loss.

## **7. Dataset Description**

We built a **custom dataset** for this project, focusing on our own handwriting styles.
